## How to use this repo

We are using a concept called an Architecture Decision Records (ADR) to document decisions made that affect projects. This
will allow us to see why decisions have been made in the past and have discussions around decisions that need to be made.

Read more about this concept here [ADRs](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions), the whole
article is in fact in the format of an ADR.

A lot more detail is available [here](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record).

Provided in the [adrs](./adr) and [pdrs](./pdr) folders are templates to create a new one including how to name your records.
