# ADR 9999: Central 2Sixty KMS Project

## Status

- [x] active
- [ ] rejected
- [ ] deprecated
- [ ] superseded

## Context

Sometimes different GCP projects want to encrypt / decrypt the same data using GCP KMS. For example:
* Common but secret encrypted settings that apply to Dev, Demo and Prod Projects.
* Credentials to be decrypted and used by Starkiller and SDC.

If the KMS of one of the projects is used it creates a dependency between projects.
The project that holds the KMS needs to exist as long as another project is using it. 
Teams need to be granted the correct IAM roles in each others project, Owners can get more permissions than required.
This is recomended by Google.

## Decision

Have one central 2Sixty KMS, with a keyring per project. Only Devops as Admins, with project leads as admins of individual key rings. 

## Consequences

Projects are dependent on the continued existence of the 2Sixty KMS project.
