# ADR 0011: Gitlab CI as the chosen CI/CD solution

## Status

- [x] active
- [ ] rejected
- [ ] deprecated
- [ ] superseded

## Context

2Sixty's current CI/CD solution is Jenkins. Its current setup is difficult to understand for new starters. There are more than 30 tabs and each tab contains 10s of jobs. Jobs are not generated with a pipeline-as-code file. It is hosted by 2Sixty, which puts extra burden on the people who have to maintain it.

Jenkins' configuration is either manual on the UI or via [groovy scripts](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Post-initialization+script).

## Decision

The decision is to use Gitlab, a managed CI/CD solution.
A comparison [document](https://about.gitlab.com/devops-tools/jenkins-vs-gitlab.html) created by Gitlab.

Main reasons for choosing Gitlab:

- yaml based pipeline-as-code: `.gitlab-ci.yml`
- better documentation
- lower maintenance
- source code and ci/cd configuration is within the same product
- the OSS jenkins does not offer failed task restart, but just the whole pipeline: [issue](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-33846)

## Consequences

- faster on-boarding process for developer teams to adopt ci/cd
- less management overhead for devops/sres, because they don't need to maintain jenkins
- we will have to migrate from Github to Gitlab
- we need to change the ci/cd pipelines of the preexisting products
